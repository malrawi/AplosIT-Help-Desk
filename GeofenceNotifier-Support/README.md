# GeoFence Notifier

**GeoFence Notifier** is an iOS application that allows you to automate location-based text messages. Simply set a location and a radius, and the app will automatically send a pre-written message to your selected contacts when you enter that area. Itâ€™s perfect for letting family or friends know you're arriving without having to use your phone while driving.

### Getting Started

To use the app, you need to set up a geofence and select the recipients for your message.

1.  **Set Your Location:**
    * **Tap and hold** on the map to drop a pin and set your target location.
    * Alternatively, use the **Search** bar to find an address.

2.  **Set Your Radius:**
    * Use the **slider** to set the radius of your geofence. The app will notify you when you enter this circle.
    * Choose your preferred unit of measure: **miles (MI)** or **kilometers (KM)**.

3.  **Add Recipients:**
    * Tap **"Selected Contacts"** to open your phone's contact list.
    * Choose one or more contacts to receive the message. Only contacts with a valid phone number will be added.

4.  **Customize Your Message:**
    * Tap **"Message to Send"** to edit the text message that will be sent. The message defaults to a dynamic text that includes your set radius.

5.  **Start Tracking:**
    * Tap **"Start Tracking Location"** to activate the geofence. The app will now monitor your location in the background.

### Canceling a Geofence

If you need to stop tracking your location, simply open the app and tap the **"Stop Tracking Location"** button.

### Important Notes

* **Permissions:** You must grant **"Always Allow"** location permission for the app to function in the background.
* **Notifications:** Your notifications are configured as **Critical Alerts** to ensure they are delivered even if your phone is in a Focus mode (like Driving or Do Not Disturb).
* **Automation:** For security reasons, the app will not send a message without your final confirmation. When you receive the notification, you will still need to tap a button to send the message.
